Linux update: Binary will attempt to run in Vulkan, otherwise fallback to OpenGL. You can use -force-glcore or -force-vulkan flags to switch between the two. Of course, chmod +x if needed after unzipping.

Press + or - to increase or decrease particle count to enable higher or lower frame rates. Press up or down to speed up or slow down the speed of the animations. Press left or right to increase or decrease bloom effect. Press space to reset.

You have to set Vsync ON, Vsync OFF, Freesync, Gsync, etc. in your GPU DRIVER control panel to test this as it by default tries to respect the GPU driver control panel setting.

The idea of this software is to simulate CPU and GPU load to see how your monitor responds across different framerates (fps). At this stage it does not "target" a particular framerate, simply add or reduce particles to increase or decrease the overall load and hence framerate. For example, if you have a Freesync 40Hz to 70Hz monitor, see if when adding or reducing particles you still see smooth motion between 40fps to 70fps.
